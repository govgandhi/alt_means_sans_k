    "In a previous notebook titled changing alt-means(/K-means) metric, we saw plots for how different the curves are for using different similarity metrics even though the change was not complete ( we still used mean for kmeans) and we don't have changes to euclidean distance. \n",
    "We want to explore why this difference exists. We saw dot performs worse, surprisingly? Normalizing vectors makes it cosine and that is similar to euclidean distance. But vector are not normalized. We even see that cosine similarity produces same as euclidean distance. How can we see under the hood, the effect of changing these metrics? The change comes in assigning points to clusters. If we can quantify how they look under the hood.  Should "
