RuleException in rule run_python_command in file /nfs/nfs9/home/nobackup/gogandhi/snakemake/Snakefile, line 31:
NameError: The name 'date' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        # Use Python within the shell command
        python -c "print('Hello, SnakeMake!')"
        
        # Access Python variables
        python -c "print('Current date:', '{date}'.format(date=datetime.now()))"
