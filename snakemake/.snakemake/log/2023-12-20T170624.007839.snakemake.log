MissingOutputException in rule run_python_command in file /nfs/nfs9/home/nobackup/gogandhi/snakemake/Snakefile, line 31:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
output.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
